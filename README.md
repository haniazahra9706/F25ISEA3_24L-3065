This repo contains the solution for ISE Assignment 3 

Q1. A palindrome is a word which remains the same if we reverse it (we read the same word if we read it
either from left to right or right to left). A few examples are as follows:
civic, racecar, abba, talat, damad
Write a program that asks a user to input a string and determines if the input string is Palindrome or Not
Palindrome. After determining the input, the program prints ‘Palindrome’ or ‘Not Palindrome’ on
console accordingly. The user can check multiple strings in single execution of your program. The user
can press ‘Esc’ to quit program.


Q2. You need to write a program for the game Hangman. Your program shall allow the user to guess the
missing letters in the word, and eventually guess the complete word. The list of words to be used in the
game is available in a text file where one word is written in one line. The player can make 7 mistakes
while guessing a word. The program shows the number remaining mistakes on console every time a
mistake is made.
When the program starts, it shows blank spaces representing the missing letters in the word read from
the text file. The player can input a letter and if the input letter exists in the word, all the blanks where
that letter appear are replaced with the letter. Otherwise number of remaining mistakes is decremented
and the updated number of remaining mistakes is shown on the console. If the remaining mistakes
become zero, and the player makes another mistake, the player loses. If all the blanks have been
replaced with the correct letter the player wins.


Q3. You need to write a program to let two players play Tic-tac-toe. Your program shall allow two players to
take turns, one player inputs ‘o’ and the other inputs ‘x’ along with the position of the input character in
empty spaces in a 3x3 grid. The program should keep on showing the updated grid after every move.
The player who has three consecutive marks diagonally, vertically, or horizontally wins the game. The
program shall display which user has won the game. In case of a draw, the program shall display game
drawn.
